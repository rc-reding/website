#   I am interested in the
#  evolution of biological membranes: why membranes are what they are, why
#  they play the role they play, from an electrical standpoint.
  
[[params.introduction.paragraph]]
  text="""Hi! I'm a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of
  Genetics at Stanford University, and my research combines engineering
  with molecular biology to develop new ways to study biological processes---
  ranging from molecular biology to microbial ecology. Although I love it,
  I'm not always tinkering with electronics.
  
  My research is curiosity-driven, and I'm particularly interested in
  microorganisms: How the environment shapes their growth dynamics, their
  interaction with surrounding genotypes; and how these influence their
  adaptation to antimicrobials. And also, what technologies can be developed
  to study them! Overall, I combine mathematical modelling with engineering,
  molecular biology and experimental evolution to study them. And sometimes I
  even manage to create some new, [useful technologies](http://mmems.org/limo/).
  
  Just because I'm a biologist doesn't mean I can't have fun, so my research
  is not constrained to a specific discipline. And so, I find myself
  oscillating between microbes, software engineering, DIY tech development and
  back. Some people like [mixing pineapple and
  pizza](https://soyummy.com/pineapple-pizza-history/). I like mixing these
  disciplines where possible. If you want to know more, check some of my
  research projects below. Note this website is constantly evolving until 
  I manage to understand how [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) works.
